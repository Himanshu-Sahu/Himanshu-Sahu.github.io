                <p>Crimes against women have more than doubled over the past ten years, according to latest.</p>

                <p>As many as 2.24 million crimes against women were reported over the past decade: 26 crimes against women
                    are reported every hour, or one complaint every two minutes</p>

                <p>The semantic meaning of &#34;crime against women&#34; is direct or indirect physical or mental cruelty to
                    women. Crimes directed specifically against women and in which only women are victims are characterised
                    as &#34;crimes against women&#34;.</p>
